## Announcement

On the latest updated policy for Unity Runtime Fee on 22 September 2023 (<https://unity.com/pricing-updates>), one of the key updates is Unity has decided to make the splash screen optional. Starting with Unity 2024 LTS (currently referred to as the 2023 LTS) or later.

## Overview

The Unity Splash Screen Remover (USSR) is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to remove the Unity splash screen logo & [watermark](https://forum.unity.com/threads/i-am-using-personal-but-there-is-trial-version-water-mark-after-build.591610/#post-3975343) from Unity-built games.

The tool is an implementation of the guide available at <https://github.com/kiraio-moe/remove-unity-splash-screen>. By utilizing this tool, you can easily remove Unity splash screen from your games and keep your own logo displayed.

## Requirements

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0 ".NET 6.0 SDK") or [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0 ".NET 8.0 SDK")
- Splash screen `Draw Mode` have been set to `All Sequential` in `Player Settings`.

## Usages

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the nightly build of USSR with the latest bug fixes in the [latest runned workflow](https://github.com/kiraio-moe/USSR/actions/workflows/build.yml) artifacts.

- Download USSR from [Releases](https://github.com/kiraio-moe/USSR/releases) page.
- Run `USSR.exe` and follow the instructions. If you're on Android or iOS platform, please read the guide below.

### Android

- Make sure you already have [`JDK`](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All "OpenJDK") & [`SDK`](https://androidsdkoffline.blogspot.com/p/all-android-sdk-latest-stable-versions.html) installed. In another word, you can build your game in Unity Editor.
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio "Android Studio") installed. Make sure to set the `JDK` and `SDK` path to the one you used for Unity Editor.
- Follow these steps:

  - **Check** `Export Project` in `Build Settings` then export.
  - After exported, **remove** the splash screen at `<export_result>/unityLibrary/src/main/assets/bin/Data/`.
  - **Remove** the backup file (`*.bak`) generated by USSR or **move** to somewhere else outside of `<export_result>`.
  - **Import** the exported project to `Android Studio`.
  - **Build** the project.
  - If you want to upload your game to app store (e.g. Google Play Store), you can `sign` your game with `keystore` and build the project as app bundle (`.aab`).  
  I won't cover those steps here, because you can find them pretty much on the internet.

### iOS

> [!WARNING]
> This section may have some incorrect information (I'm not an expert on this). Feel free to create Issue/Pull Request if there's mistake.

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ "Xcode") installed.
- There's no fancy settings to be checked, just **Build** (export) the project.
- **Remove** the splash screen at `<export_result>/Data/`.
- **Remove** the backup file (`*.bak`) generated by USSR or **move** to somewhere else outside of `<export_result>`.
- **Open** `Unity-iPhone.xcodeproj` with Xcode, then proceed to build.  
  If you're an iOS developer, you know what to do next, right?
